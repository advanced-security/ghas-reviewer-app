## Usage

GHAS Reviewer is a Python based web application which primarily uses Docker for easy deployment.

### GitHub Application Configuration

[Checkout how to setup a GitHub App here](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app).

Store the App key so the service can read it from the path provided along with the other environment variables or cli arguments.

**Environment Variable:**

```env
# Application ID
GITHUB_APP_ID=123456
# Path to the App private key
GITHUB_APP_KEY_PATH=./config/key.pem
# or use the private key directly
GITHUB_APP_KEY=-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...
# Webhook Secret
GITHUB_APP_SECRET=123456789012345678901234567890
```

#### Permissions

The GitHub App requires the following permissions:

- Repository
  - [x] Security Events: Read & Write

### Container / Docker

The application is designed to be run in a container, this allows for easy deployment and scaling.

**Pull / Download image:**

```bash
# Pull latest (or a release)
docker pull ghcr.io/advanced-security/ghas-reviewer-app:main
```

**Or Build From Source:**

```bash
docker build -t {org}/ghas-reviewer-app .
```

**Run Docker Image:**

```bash
docker run \
    --env-file=.env \
    -v ./config:/ghasreview/config \
    -p 8000:8000 \ 
    ghcr.io/advanced-security/ghas-reviewer-app:main
```

### Docker Compose

If you are testing the GitHub App you can quickly use Docker Compose to spin-up the container.

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```
